25-5 Clock React.js Project

After almost a week, of slamming my head into a table I realised few things.
First, you can't use Moment.js or any plugins for Moment.js!
Second, if you decide to run tests and you go on other tab to check something, or change
music (I listen to music on YT when I am coding) then few tests will fail! If you want
to be 100% sure that tests are done properly, wait until tests are done and then
go and switch music, or do whatever you have opened in other tabs!

Man, after reading forums and finding about Moment.js and realising that
you can't use it, I already spent three days trying to figure out why time is not being
formatted properly!!! And today, I realised that I might have had working code from start
but I did not know since tests would fail if you switch to YT tab opened in Firefox to change
your playlist!!!

Tehnically, my code worked more or less, few changes were needed, one important was that I
did not implement state in which I would manipulate changes.  

Thankfully, I am done with freecodecamp projects and I can focus now on 100 js projects, 100 dailyUI challenges
and I am hoping to find 100 react.js projects so I can practice and learn react with practice.

See ya, in next project!
